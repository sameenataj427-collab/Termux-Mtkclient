# ​Key Details
​Zero Root Required: Unlike the original mtkclient, this version is designed to run in a standard Termux environment without root access.
​Optimized for Mobile: All GUI, Windows-specific, and non-essential files have been stripped to keep the script small and fast.
​Enhanced Connection: Features a custom polling loop that looks for USB devices thousands of times per second to overcome Android's single-look limitation.

​**How to use the tool**
1. ​First run the command you want.

2.​Then press Enter and wait for the text "Waiting for device connection...".

3. ​Then connect your target phone by holding its Volume Up and Volume Down buttons to the host phone via OTG or a type c to type c cable

4. if you are using a otg, tge otg should be connected to the host phone, not the target phone

5. ​Then quickly press OK on the Termux API popup as soon as it appears, as you only have ~3 seconds befor the target phone timeouts snd reboots.

6. ​Then the scripts will handle the rest.

# Guid To Install The Tool 👇👇

First install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_1022.apk) and [Termux:api](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux.api_1002.apk) from Fdroid or GitHub, dont use termux from playstore, that is a outdated version and it doesn't have the nessary pakages for the tool to run

```bash
​pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install python git termux-api libusb clang binutils -y
```
```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venv
git clone https://github.com/sameenataj427-collab/MTKClient-NoRoot-Termux
cd MTKClient-NoRoot-Termux
. ~/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

# ​Flags that can be used in command and help to make work easy
​There are two types of flags that can be used; both have different formats to be used in:
​
# First type:
​Format: python3 mtk.py [command] --[flag]

1. ​--force: Bypasses signature or size mismatches to force a flash.

2. ​--reset: Commands the device to reboot normally once the process is complete.

3. ​--skip [partition]: Tells the script to ignore a specific partition during a bulk read/write.

# Second type:
​Format: python3 mtk.py --[flag] [command]

​1. --nobatt: Used for devices that require being connected without a battery to trigger BROM.

​2. --stage2: Forces the SLA/DAA bypass payload for newer, secured MediaTek chipsets.

3. ​--debugmode: Provides a full log of the connection process to find where it is failing.

THESE ARE ONLY THE MOST USED FLAGS IN BOOTH TYPES , I CAN ADD ALL OF THEM, IF I DID THE REPOSITORY WILL BE 200 TO 300 LINS LONG AND IMPOSSIBLE TO READ
